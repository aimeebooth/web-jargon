# Browsers

## A browser
A software application that browses through websites available on the world wide web.

## URL
Universal resource locator, fancy talk for a web address.

Example: `http://github.com`

A URL does **not** require `www` in front of it to be correct, so you can stop saying the awfully redundant "dub dub dub". 

## www
That stands for worldwide web (yes, it should be `ww`). For a long time it was a required prefix to all website URLs. Not anymore, unless the maintainer of the domain is stuck in the 1990's.

## Cookies
Unlike what you were told by the misinformed masses, cookies are mostly harmless pieces of text that contain often incredibly useful information for both you and the owners of websites. 

They're often used to prevent people from having to type in their credentials every single time they want to access a private account on a website.

Yes, they're also used by advertisment networks to track some basic information about visistors across websites. It's shady, but not nearly as invasive as it's made out to be.

## Bookmarks & Favorites
A simple (and usually clumsy) way for browsers to help you remember a specific website.

## Plugins & Extensions
Depending on the browsers, extensions allow you to add functionality. For instance they offer integration with other software applications installed on your own computer. They can also be useful to take screenshots, or even peek under the covers of a website.
